		<h2>Why did i start this Project</h2><br>
			<p>The idea to create this website came when i was finding things to work upon my skills of Web Development during this lockdown. Thats when i decided to pursue a course of Web Development from Coursera. The course was <strong>HTML, CSS & JavaScript for Web Developers</strong> by <strong>Johns Hopkins Univeristy</strong>. There in the last assignment, i was told to built a Restaurant web application. The front page of web app should contain 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map. If i click on the Specials tile, i will be taken to a single category page where all the menu items that belong to the Specials menu category will be shown. My task in that assignment was to alter this behavior such that when the user clicks on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category, be it "Lunch", "Dinner", "Sushi", etc. That way, any random category can become the Specials!</p><br>
			<p><stong>And for that i came up with this Website</stong></p>
